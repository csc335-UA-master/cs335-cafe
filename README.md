# cafe-335

We have a small Point of Sale terminal for a coffee shop that has a Loyalty Program 
to reward repeat customers. Every fifth visit, the customer gets a 10% discount.

We will model the store as a loop of customers who visit and make multiple orders. You
can close down the store by entering ``exit``. This will permanently cause it to go
out of business (brutal!). 

We have provided a UML diagram for the missing PunchCard class that you can load into
http://draw.io to view. Turn that diagram into the implementation of PunchCard. 

For the other classes, add them to the UML diagram and make sure to submit everything via
github by next week's section.
